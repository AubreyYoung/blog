## Purpose

These steps will allow you to change the passwords for SYS, SYSTEM, and the
oracle user at the operating system level.

## Scope

This note is meant to be used by database administrators who have to change
the passwords of the privileged users.

## Details

To change the SYS and SYSTEM passwords, perform the following steps:  
  
1\. Log into Oracle as internal or sysdba  
  
$ svrmgrl command="connect internal"  
\- or -  
$ sqlplus "/ as sysdba"  
  
2\. Type the following commands:  
  

ALTER USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY [password];  
ALTER USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY [password];

  
3\. Log off of Oracle and reconnect as SYS or SYSTEM and test the new password  
  
  
Note that any OS user who is a member of the osdba group (usually 'dba')can
run 'sqlplus / as sysdba'.  
Because of this it is recommended to change the password of the OS users who
are members of this group.  
To change a password at the OS level, perform the following steps:  
  
For UNIX  
\--------  
A. Log in as the oracle software owner, usually 'oracle'.  
B. Type the following:  
  
passwd  
  
C. It will prompt you for the current password, enter current password.  
D. It will then prompt you for the new password, enter the new password.  
E. It will then ask for a confirmation of new password, re-enter new password.
